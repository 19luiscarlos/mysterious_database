# mysterious_database
A mysterious database was given to me and the task was simply exploration. With no knowledge of variable names, the origin of it, or why it came in 15 subsets, I began to wonder if the columns followed any specific structure. What I came up with was a set of graphs that help visualize the (non-existing) progressions within columns.

The files can be found in the data folder. The original file is 'Datos.csv', and I split it into different .csv files, which are used in the R code. My goal was to show that beautiful visualization may come from simple data and simple tecniques (no additional libraries are needed other than base R). Those plots are in the .pdf file (with a little math foreword on arithmetic sequences in Spanish).
